This is the code for my project I created for those Dungeon Masters. It is specifically for the campaign of Icewind Dale but can be changed to fit your specific campaign.
The code looks at 3 main things that DM's look at: Naming an NPC, generating a wilderness encounter, and calculating the Challenge rating of a monster or monsters.
Naming an NPC prompts for the race and gender. Wilderness encounter will prompt if you want a specific encounter (I put in herd just in case you don't want to go into combat). 
Challenge rating isn't always accurate when considering the whole of the players. For instance you might have a balanced party with a tank and support but you also might have a party with all support. The challenge will then be different so judge wisely. This just adds the number of level of each player and averages it then divides the average by the total challenge rating of each creature to figure out what difficulty it is.
